## Problem Statement
In the realm of healthcare management, individuals often encounter challenges in understanding the potential side effects of prescribed medications, leading to uncertainties about their treatment decisions. Despite advancements in machine learning (ML) techniques, existing models may exhibit limitations in accurately predicting drug side effects, thereby impacting user confidence in the information provided. Additionally, while web-based platforms offer convenience in medical record maintenance, ensuring seamless integration with ML-generated insights remains a critical yet unaddressed aspect.

## Solution Points:

1. **Enhance ML Model Accuracy:** Continuously refine and optimize the ML model, leveraging techniques such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble learning to improve the accuracy of drug side effect predictions beyond the current 65% threshold.
2. **Integrate ML Model with Web Application:** Seamlessly integrate the ML model into the existing web application architecture, ensuring efficient data flow and real-time predictions for users accessing drug information and side effects.
3. **User Authentication and Profile Creation:** Implement robust user authentication mechanisms to secure user data and enable personalized experiences. Allow users to create profiles within the web application, enabling them to input and manage their medical records securely.
4. **Medical Record Management:** Develop user-friendly interfaces within the web application to enable users to input, update, and organize their medical records comprehensively. Ensure data integrity and privacy compliance standards are met to safeguard sensitive health information.
5. **Interactive Dashboard for Drug Effects:** Design and implement an interactive dashboard within the web application to visualize the effects of different drugs based on the ML model predictions. Provide intuitive data visualization tools and filters to allow users to explore and understand drug side effects effectively.
6. **Educational Resources and Recommendations:** Offer educational resources and personalized recommendations to users based on their medical history and drug profiles. Empower users with actionable insights and guidance to make informed decisions regarding medication usage and potential side effects.
